Format 5: Mind Maps
-------------------

**Description:** Mind maps are visual representations of information and ideas, often starting with a central concept and branching out into related subtopics.

**Ideal Use Cases:**

* Brainstorming and idea generation.
* Organizing thoughts and concepts.

**Description:** Outlines use a hierarchical structure to organize information. They are excellent for creating structured plans or detailed project documentation.

**Ideal Use Cases:**

* Developing comprehensive project plans.
* Writing reports, essays, or research papers.
* Organizing complex information for presentations.

Format 7: Spreadsheets
----------------------

**Description:** Spreadsheets use rows and columns to create tables of data. They are versatile for various tasks, from data analysis to task tracking.
